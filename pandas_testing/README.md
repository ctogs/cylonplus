# Project Name Readme

Welcome to the Pandas (Normal) Testing repository! This readme will guide you through setting up the project environment and running tests.

## Setup

1. **Create Conda Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environments.yml
   ```
   This command will create a conda environment named `pandas-test` based on the specifications listed in the `environments.yml` file.

2. **Activate Conda Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate pandas-test
   ```
   This command activates the newly created conda environment.

## Running Tests

To run tests for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Tests Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   python <test-name>.py <args (can be more than 1)>
   ```
   This command will execute the tests and provide feedback on the functionality of the project. Currently, the tests contain placeholder text and will be updated with meaningful tests in the future.

That's it! You've successfully set up the project environment and executed tests.
