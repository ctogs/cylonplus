## Installation instructions UVA CS cluster

Useful information aboyt the portal cluster is available at <https://www.cs.virginia.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=compute_portal> available resources are described at 
<https://www.cs.virginia.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=compute_resources>.

### Login to cluster

```bash
ssh your_computing_id@gpusrv08 -J your_computing_id@portal.cs.virginia.edu
```

### Setup Cylon

Please chose a directory in which you like to deploy the code. 
At this time we assume you install it in your home directory.

If not create a new directory and cd into it and follow the next steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arupcsedu/cylonplus.git
cd cylonplus
module load anaconda3

conda create -n cyp-venv python=3.11
conda activate cyp-venv

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
DIR=/u/djy8hg/anaconda3/envs/cyp-venv
# this should be 
# DIR=/u/$USER/anaconda3/envs/cyp-venv
 
export CUDA_HOME=$DIR/bin
export PATH=$DIR/bin:$PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH PYTHONPATH=$DIR/lib/python3.11/site-packages 

pip install petastorm

cd src/model
python multi-gpu-cnn.py

```

## Installation instructions UVA Rivanna cluster

We assume that you are able to ssh into rivanna instead of using the ondemand system. This is easily done by following instructions given on <https://infomall.org>. Make sure to modify your .ssh/config file and add the host rivanna according to <https://infomall.org/uva/docs/tutorial/rivanna/>.

If you use Windows we recommand not to use putty but use gitbash as it mimics a bash environment that is typical also for Linux systems and thus we only have to maintaine one documentation.

### Login to cluster

```bash
ssh rivanna
```

### Setup a PROJECT dir

We assume you will deplyt the code in /scratch/$USER. Note this directory is not backed up. Make sure to backup your changes regularly elsewhere with rsync or use github.

NOTE: the following is yet untested

```bash
export PROJECT=/scratch/$USER/workdir
mkdir -p $PROJECT
cd $PROJECT
```

### Setup Cylon

TODO: best to convert to slurm script and run on node as batch script

```bash
rivanna>
  git clone https://github.com/arupcsedu/cylonplus.git
  cd cylonplus
  module load anaconda3

  conda create --prefix=$PROJECT/CYLONPLUS cyp-venv python=3.11
  conda activate --prefix=$PROJECT/CYLONPLUS

  conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

  export PYTHON_DIR=$PROJECT/CYLONPLUS #?
  export CUDA_HOME=$PYTHON_DIR/bin # should that be cuda prefix?
  export PATH=$PYTHON_DIR/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PYTHON_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHON_DIR/lib/python3.11/site-packages 

  pip install petastorm
```

once converted to a slurm script called `install.slurm` execute

```bash
sbatch install.slurm
```

### Running the program

create a slurm script that includes 

script.slurm:

```bash
TODO: add the slurm parameters in the script. see rivanna documentation
cd src/model
python multi-gpu-cnn.py
```

submit the script

```bash
sbatch script.slurm
```
